1. Navbar hover to be implement as shown in each picture. When scrolling over the 
navbar and each corresponding  product the drop down list should appear. This should
occur on the following pages: RENTALS, AIR QUALITY, WATER SAMPLING, WATER QUALITY, WATER LEVEL, WEATHER,
SURVEY, SOUND, SOIL.

2. The items in the navbar should be clickable, for example if I were to click on Photo Ionization Devices
in the water quality tab it would take me to the the Air Quality Page on the part of the page where Photo 
Ionization devices are located. This should be done for all items in the navbar.

2. Product layout to be edited like the image "product layout image" currently the images are placed
together with no spacing inbetween them. I would like to implement the same size and the same space inbetween
each image as the picture "product layout image" if you would a live reference please refer to https://shop.tesla.com/en_ca/category/charging

3. Responsiveness should be adjusted for mobile screens to stack instead of shrink
